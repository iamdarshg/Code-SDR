## 2024-05-20 - Single vs. Dual Convolution for Complex Signals
**Learning:** In `digital_downconverter.py`, the `_apply_lowpass_filter` function was performing two separate `fftconvolve` operations—one on the real part and one on the imaginary part of the complex signal. Combining these into a single `fftconvolve` on the complex signal itself resulted in a 28% reduction in the combined pipeline processing time. This is because `scipy.signal.fftconvolve` is optimized for complex inputs, and a single operation reduces Python overhead.
**Action:** When I encounter filtering or convolution operations on complex-valued data, I will ensure they are performed in a single operation rather than being split by real and imaginary components.
