This file contains realistic ADC sample data for testing the SDR system.

Test data includes:
- 10-bit signed ADC samples (values: 0-1023)
- Sample rate: 105 MSPS
- Test patterns: Sine waves at various frequencies, noise, edge cases
- Format: Binary data (16-bit words, MSB-aligned)
- Total samples: 10,000 test vectors

Use this file with testbenches to validate ADC interface and processing pipeline.
